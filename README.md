This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Supabase authentication

The client portal at `/client` uses Supabase Auth. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and provide:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-anon-or-publishable-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

In Supabase Authentication, add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` and the deployed equivalent to the allowed redirect URLs. The password-reset flow uses this callback to establish a session before opening `/auth/update-password`.

Roles are read only from the server-controlled `app_metadata.role` claim. Supported values are `admin` and `client`; accounts without an explicit role default to `client`.

## Database migration

Apply the migrations in `supabase/migrations/` in filename order with the Supabase CLI or SQL editor before using the portal data tables. They create the portal schema, profile trigger, role-aware Row Level Security policies, private inquiry tables, CRM workflows and the private `project-files` storage bucket.

`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is used only by server-side inquiry routes to save public contact and project requests. Never expose it to the browser or prefix it with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

Set `RATE_LIMIT_SALT` to a long, private random value in production. It is used to hash request-origin keys for the durable public-form rate limit.

The request limit uses Vercel's edge-provided `x-vercel-forwarded-for` header. On another host, configure a trusted proxy integration before enabling public forms; otherwise all non-Vercel traffic shares one conservative rate-limit bucket.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
